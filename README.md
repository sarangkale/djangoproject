Blog Website

These are all the files used in my project to make a blog website using Django.
If you want to check my website out, clone this repository.
Then open the terminal, navigate to your project directory, and type the command "python manage.py runserver" into the terminal.
This will generate a link you can click to view my website on a local host server!
