# djangoproject
Blog Website

These are all the files used in my project to make a blog website using Django.
If you want to check my website out, download these files into your VS Code and install Django.
Then open the terminal and go to your project directory then type the command "python manage.py runserver"
This will generate a link you can click to see my website!
